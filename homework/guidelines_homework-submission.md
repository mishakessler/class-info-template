# Homework Submission Guidelines

> This is the typical procedure for submitting homework, but it will occasionally vary.

1. Find the repo for the homework assignment in our class' Github Enterprise organization "sei-nyc-cheetahs".
2. Fork the homework repo to your own Github Enterprise account.
3. Clone your forked repo to your machine.
4. Do the homework. Add, commit and push your changes to origin (your forked repo on GHE).
5. Open a pull request to the original homework repo (the one you forked from). Be sure to make the title of the PR your first and last name.
6. Please note that you are required to rate your completion out of 3 (where 0 means didn't start, 1 means incomplete, 2 means complete and 3 means complete with bonuses) and your comfort out of 5 in the comment section of your pull request in order for your homeowrk to be considered complete.
7. If you want feedback on the homework, please include your question(s) in the comment section of your pull request.

Unless otherwise specified, homework is due the night it is assigned by 11pm.
