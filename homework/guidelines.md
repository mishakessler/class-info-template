# HOMEWORK GUIDELINES

This is the typical procedure for submitting homework, but it will occasionally vary.

**Starting Your Homework:**

1. Find the Git Enterprise repository for the homework assignment.
2. **Fork** the homework repository to your own Github Enterprise account.
3. **Clone** your forked repository to have a local copy on your computer.
4. **Do the homework.**

**Submitting Your Homework:**

5. **Add**, **commit** and **push** your completed homework to your origin master.
6. **Open a pull request** to the original homework repository, from which you forked your homework.
7. **Title your pull request** with your first and last name, no special characters.
8. Use the pull request comment section using [the homework submission template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-supernovas/class-info/blob/master/homework/template_homework-submission.md). Please note that you are required to rate your completion and your comfort levels; if you want feedback on the homework, please include your question(s) in the comment section of your pull request.

Unless otherwise specified, homework is due the night it is assigned by 11:00PM.
