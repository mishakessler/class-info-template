# HOMEWORK SUBMISSIONS

| **Self Assessment** |              |
| :------------------ | :----------- |
| Completeness        | 5 (out of 5) |
| Comfort             | 3 (out of 5) |

## Win

- It took me a while to understand `Array.map`, but once I grasped the callback concept it was smooth as John Coltrane Jazz.  

## Struggle

- Passing a function as an argument without execution of the function was complex to understand.

## Questions & Comments

- Do I have to put the parentheses while passing the function name in the parameters?
- Loved the lesson, but I'm a little bit stuck with resolving promises... some extra material and exercises would help.
