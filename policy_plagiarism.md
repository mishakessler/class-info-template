# PLAGIARISM

**Remember**, General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater engineering community. Any work considered to have been plagiarized **will not be accepted** and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarizing or attempting to plagiarize will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to forced withdrawal from the program).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:

- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
