# ATTENDANCE & TARDINESS POLICY

Attendance is taken both in the morning and evening.

- You must be on time and ready to **begin the day by 9:00AM** to be considered present for morning attendance.
- You must remain on campus or in the remote classroom until class is dismissed, **and you must submit your daily mini-survey** to be considered present for evening attendance.

**Please note:**

- You are allowed **no more** than 3 total unexcused absences. Tardiness counts towards your total absences. (3 unexcused late arrivals = 1 full unexcused absence)

Absences and late arrivals may be marked "excused" on a case-by-case basis if you communicate a valid reason for the absence/lateness. That said, **you must communicate with your instructional team via private slack message in any event that you will miss class or arrive late, regardless of whether or not it will be excused.** We are responsible for you during the coursework hours, so we take this very seriously. (Please send a single direct message via slack copying **all** instructors.)
