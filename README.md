# Course Policies

## Attendance & Tardiness

* Attendance is taken both in the morning and evening.
  * You must be on time and ready to **begin the day by 9:00AM** to be considered present for morning attendance.
  * You must remain on campus, in the classroom, until class is dismissed, **and you must submit your daily mini-survey**, to be considered present for evening attendance.

**Please note:**

* You are allowed **no more** than 3 total unexcused absences.
* Your late arrivals count towards your total absences. (3 unexcused lates = 1 unexcused absence)
  * Arriving in class by **more than 5 minutes past class start** time is a late arrival.

Absences and late arrivals may be marked "excused" on a case-by-case basis if you communicate a valid reason for the absence/lateness.

**You must communicate with your leadership team via private slack in any event that you will miss class or arrive late, regardless of whether or not it will be excused.** We are responsible for you during the coursework hours, so we take this very seriously. Please send a new direct message via slack to **all** instructors.

<br>

## Homework Submission

* Homework submissions are due by 11PM. Missing homeworks will not be accepted. Incomplete homeworks can be completed, but will not be accepted after the unit ends.

See both the [homework submission guidelines](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-supernovas/class-info/wiki/Guidelines_Homework-Submissions) and the [homework PR template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-supernovas/class-info/wiki/Template_Homework-Submissions) for more.

## Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater engineering community. Any work considered to have been plagiarized **will not be accepted** and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class ‚Äúscience fair‚Äù or ‚Äúmeet & greet.‚Äù Any student found plagiarizing or attempting to plagiarize will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to forced withdrawal from the program).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:

- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else‚Äôs idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.

In an effort to not plagiarize, credit for this content goes to:

- [Plagiarism.org](http://plagiarism.org/), specifically the ‚Äúplagiarism 101‚Äù section.  Content was adapted for code.  For more information, please see:
