# Course Policies

## Attendance & Tardiness

* Attendance is taken both in the morning and evening.
  * You must be on time and ready to begin the day by 9:00AM to be considered present for morning attendance.
  * You must remain on campus, in the classroom, until class is dismissed, and you must submit your exit tickets, to be considered present for evening attendance.

**Please note:**

* You are allowed **no more** than 3 unexcused absences.
  * Absences will be marked "excused" if you can provide a doctor's note or communicate the absence in advance.

* You are allowed **no more** than 9 late arrivals. 
  * Arriving in class by more than 5 minutes past class start time.
  * 3 unexcused late arrivals = 1 full, unexcused absence.
  * Late arrivals will be marked "excused" if you communicate with your leadership team within 20 minutes of class start.

**You must communicate with your leadership team via private slack in any event that you will miss class or arrive late.** (Preferably all instructors, in the event one of us doesn't receive the message or is not working the morning hours.) We are responsible for you during the coursework hours, so we take this very seriously.
